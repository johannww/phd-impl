# Interoperability Chaincode

This folder contains the interoperability chaincode, similar to the examples described by Hyperledger Cacti.

For more information, see the Hyperledger Cacti repository: https://github.com/hyperledger-cacti/cacti, mainly `weaver/` examples, which contains a separate chaincode for gateway/relay communication.

See the weaver lib: https://github.com/hyperledger-cacti/cacti/blob/bdea8f5ce5072d3e602e0d0703484282eb5e408b/weaver/core/network/fabric-interop-cc/libs/utils/utils.go#L1-L550
